Game Title: Guess the Pin

Game description:

A fun and challenging two-player game where each player tries to guess the opponent's secret 3-digit number.

Game Mechanics:
Both players secretly choose a 3-digit number.
Players take turns guessing the other player's number, trying to get the correct digits in the correct order.
Each player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number (e.g., 5 attempts).
A time limit is set for each guess (e.g., 30 seconds). Failing to guess within the time results in a forfeited turn.
After each incorrect guess, the player receives a hint:
Correct Digit and Position: The number of digits that are correct and in the right position.
Correct Digit but Wrong Position: The number of correct digits in the wrong position.
The game consists of multiple rounds. The player who wins the most rounds becomes the overall winner.
The first player to guess the opponentâ€™s number correctly within the allowed attempts and time wins the round.
